# Entry 1

I have been considering many topics when making my website. Most of the topics I chose were technological and were very popular ideas throughout the class. In the end, I didn't choose anything technology-based, but instead science-based. As a person, I usually lack sleep due to homework and studying for up coming exams. I always wonder why a human being needed at least 8 hours of sleep a day to function properly. So, I thought of studying the field of science neurology or psychology to understand why.

Many teens are also suffering from lost of sleep due to school. They would often procrastinate or are extremely busy or stressed out from the work school gives them, so my target audience for my topic is mainly focused on teenagers. I first started by gathering some basic information about how sleep affects your mind and behavior. I came across many articles and documentations. One of the articles that stuck out to me was https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201905/the-new-science-sleep. This article helps explain a few details about why sleep is important, ways to help you get enough sleep and how an inefficient amount of sleep can affect a person's mind. Skills I learned from doing my project are communication and learning how to Google. I've gotten better at conveying my ideas with peers and hearing their intake on my topic. I also learned how to Google better by knowing what specific words I should Google to get the articles and links I want. 

Concerning the engineering design process, I'm at the very first step: defining the problem. I plan on continuing my research as of how teens are being affected by lack of sleep.
